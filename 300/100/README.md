# 100 - Installation

Visit [Download | Nix & NixOS](https://nixos.org/download.html).

**NOTE**: When using [DokPloy](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/dokploy), NixOS is already installed and therefore we do not need to install it separately.

See https://nixpacks.com/docs/deploying/dokploy and https://docs.dokploy.com/en/application/build-type
